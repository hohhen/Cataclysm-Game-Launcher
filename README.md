A Visual Basic Based launcher

  This Launcher follows the versioning system of the Wow Client in which its provides for
  It Will upgrade any client from 3.3.5a up to 4.3.4, internally set to download three key
  files that are required for wow to upgrade to 4.3.4 directly from the Blizzard Dist Server.
  
  Once Wow is patched, it will continuously check for missing or corrupt files and retrive them for you.
  It is also scripted to update itself whenever we release a new version.
